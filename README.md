# SVM_ProteinFoldRecognition

Final project of a Genetic Engineering course at Ryerson University in the department of Biomedical Engineering.

This project reads a data base of amino acid sequences for various proteins and extracts various features for each one.  The features were then used to train and test a support vector machine implemented using SKLearn.  The results were then analyzed and intepreted using statistical analysis.
